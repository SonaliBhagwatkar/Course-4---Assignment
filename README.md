# Course-4---Assignment
Assignment - Software Engineering Frameworks and Server Side Development


I have implemented first three functionalities which are
    a. Issue with accessing images with similar names
    b. Issues while editing / deleting the files of another users
    c. Problem of password authentication
    
    
These all first three problems I was able to complete on 07/04/2019. However I was facing the problem in the code for completing the 
comment feature part. I have solved that issue and uploaded the the complete solution. But the partwise solution was submitted last time.
Also I was facing problems in accessing some github commands so this time I have reloved and reinstalled the git and uploaded them again..
I have created branches for;

branch1: for the solution of Issue with accessing images with similar names
branch2: for solution of Issues while editing / deleting the files of another users
branch3: for solution Problem of password authentication
branch4: for the complete solution of the assignment.

This is what the whole I want to convey..

Thanks!!
